        <section class="publication-section">
            <div class="publication-note">
                My research focuses on Human-centered AI and Human-centered Interaction. Rather than limiting to traditional Human-Computer Interaction, I explore interactions that extend beyond computers to various hardware devices such as vehicles and robots. Regardless of the domain, my work centers on empowering users, enhancing user experiences, and leveraging technology to support societal development with humans at the core.
